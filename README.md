# Passkey Demo

This React Ã— Python app is my take on a simple passkey demo using WebAuthn passkeys (biometrics/security keys) using only some simple requests from the frontend with the passwordless-id package, and proper authentication from the Flask backend. It was made for me to learn about Passkeys so I could implement it in some other apps.

## Installation

- Python 3.8+
